# Cascade_Backend_Developer_Assessment
NOTE: All work for this position is done using .NET Core 6, C#, and SQL.

# Overview
This exercise is intended to take no longer than 4 to 6 hours.  Please limit the detail of your solution with that time in mind.  Please include a README with your submission detailing your solution. The solution must be COMPLETE and TESTABLE with test data. Make sure to include all necessary scripts and test data.

## Data definition

```
public class Book
{
	public string Publisher { get; set; }
	public string Title { get; set; }
	public string AuthorLastName { get;set }
	public string AuthorFirstName { get; set; }
	public decimal Price {get;set;}
}
```

## Problem
1.	Create a REST API using ASP.NET MVC and write a method to return a sorted list of these by Publisher, Author (last, first), then title.

2.	If you had to create one or more tables to store the Book data in a MS SQL database, outline the table design along with fields and their datatypes. 

3.	Write another API method to add an entry to the Book table.	

4.	Write stored procedures in MS SQL Server for steps 1 and 3, and use them in separate API methods to return the same results.

5.	Write an API method to return the total price of all books in the database.

6.	If you have a large list of these in memory and want to save the entire list to the MS SQL Server database, what is the most efficient way to save the list with only one call to the DB server?

7.	Add a property to the Book class that outputs the MLA (Modern Language Association) style citation as a string (https://images.app.goo.gl/YkFgbSGiPmie9GgWA). Please add whatever additional properties the Book class needs to generate the citation.

8.	Add another property to generate a Chicago style citation (Chicago Manual of Style) (https://images.app.goo.gl/w3SRpg2ZFsXewdAj7).
